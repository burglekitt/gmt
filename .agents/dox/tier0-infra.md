# Tier 0 reference pack — infrastructure (`DOX-A1`, `DOX-A2`)

Loaded by `dox-builder` for the workspace skeleton and the Cloudflare deploy. Does not
restate `dox-builder.md`'s universal invariants.

**Verified against the live repo and the npm registry on 2026-08-26.** Everything below was
checked by running the command, not read out of `context/dox/`. Where this pack contradicts
`context/dox/issues/DOX-A.md`, this pack is correct and the issue predates the finding.

## Verified findings that contradict the issue spec

### 1. The toolchain is `fnm`, and the shell is on Node 20

`node -v` → `v20.19.6`, resolved from `~/.local/state/fnm_multishells/...`. `.nvmrc` is
`24`. `astro@7.2.7` declares `engines.node: ">=22.12.0"`.

The issue says "`nvm use` first". **It is `fnm`.** And because shell state does not persist
between tool calls, the switch must be part of every compound command.

**`fnm use` on its own is a silent no-op in a non-interactive shell** — verified:

```console
$ fnm use && node -v
Using Node v24.19.0     ← claims success
v20.19.6                ← still on 20
```

It exits 0 while changing nothing, which is the worst possible failure shape. The env must
be eval'd first:

```bash
eval "$(fnm env)" && fnm use && pnpm install   # → v24.19.0, and pnpm exec node agrees
```

CI is unaffected — `actions/setup-node@v4` with `node-version: 22` resolves to the latest
22.x, which is above the floor, and the matrix also runs 24.

### 2. `oxlint.config.js` is never loaded — the `files.include` edit is a no-op

```console
$ pnpm exec oxlint --print-config
{ "plugins": ["unicorn", "typescript", "oxc"], ... }
```

Stock defaults. The repo's own `plugin` and `recommendedRules` from
`packages/gmt-oxlint/dist/index.js` are **absent**. Oxlint's discovery list is
`.oxlintrc.json`, `.oxlintrc.jsonc`, `oxlint.config.ts`, `oxlint.config.mts` — **`.js` is
not in it**, and root `package.json` runs bare `oxlint` with no `-c`.

Consequences:

- Adding `apps/**` to `files.include` does **nothing**. Land the edit because the story asks
  for it and it documents intent, but do not report it as the mechanism that lints the app.
- **The real mechanism is an explicit `lint` target in `apps/docs/project.json`** running
  `oxlint` with explicit paths. Without it, `nx run-many -t lint` resolves to exactly one
  task (`@northguild/gmt:lint`, the only project with a `lint` script) and stays green while
  ignoring the entire new app.
- This is a **pre-existing repo bug** — the GMT lint plugin is not running on `packages/**`
  either. It is out of scope for `DOX-A1`. File it separately; do not try to fix the root
  config inside this story.

### 3. The `@astrojs/markdown-remark` peer is **optional** — do not declare it

`context/dox/` says Starlight "peers on `astro ^7.0.2` _and_
`@astrojs/markdown-remark ^7.2.0` — the second peer is easy to miss" and instructs you to
verify both. Verified, and the instruction is wrong:

```console
$ npm view @astrojs/starlight@0.41.9 peerDependenciesMeta --json
{ "@astrojs/markdown-remark": { "optional": true } }
```

It is an **optional** peer. Starlight 0.41.9 depends on `@astrojs/markdown-satteri ^0.3.5`
directly, and `astro@7.2.7` ships `@astrojs/markdown-satteri@0.3.8` — the remark package is
the older path, kept as an optional peer for compatibility.

**Do not add `@astrojs/markdown-remark` to `apps/docs`.** Confirmed empirically: a full
`pnpm install` with only `astro` and `@astrojs/starlight` declared produces **no peer
warning** for it. Declaring it would pull a package the site does not use.

### 4. `prebuild` / `predev` never fire

`pnpm config get enable-pre-post-scripts` → `undefined` (pnpm 10 defaults it to false), and
there is no `.npmrc` in the repo.

The issue asks for a version map generated "in a `prebuild`/`predev` step". Implemented
literally, **the script never runs**, the generated module fails to resolve, and the build
dies with a confusing "module not found" that points nowhere near the cause.

**Chain explicitly with `&&`, and make it an Nx target:**

```json
"build": "pnpm run generate && astro build",
"typecheck": "pnpm run generate && astro sync && astro check"
```

### 5. Nx infers nothing for an Astro app, and would misname it

No `project.json` exists anywhere in the repo today. `@nx/js/typescript` keys `build` on the
presence of `tsconfig.build.json`, which an Astro app will not have.

Two traps:

- Without `"name": "docs"` in `project.json`, Nx names the project `@gmt/docs` from
  `package.json`, and the DoD command `nx run docs:build` fails with "Cannot find project
  'docs'" — a one-word omission failing the story.
- Without `"nx": { "includedScripts": [] }` in `package.json`, **every** script becomes an
  inferred target and merges messily with the `project.json` definitions. `[]` is truthy, so
  it yields zero inferred script targets and makes `project.json` the single source of truth.
  Scripts stay in `package.json` so `pnpm --filter @gmt/docs build` still works standalone.

### 6. `.oxfmtrc.json` is an allow-list the issue does not mention

Its `overrides` blocks cover `packages/**`, `docs/**`, `context/**`, `scripts/**`. Without a
matching `apps/**` entry, **`pnpm format` silently skips the entire new app.** Add one.

### 7. CI routing for `apps/**` works, but vacuously

Traced through all four jobs for an `apps/**`-only PR:

- `determine-affected` → `gmt_changed=false`, `non_gmt_changed=true`, `any_changed=true`.
- `build-lint` → **this is where docs work is actually validated.** `nx affected -t lint
  typecheck build` picks up `docs`, and `dependsOn: ["^build"]` pulls in
  `@northguild/gmt:build` as a task dependency. The job's `rm -rf .nx/cache` step means the
  cold-cache build-order check is exercised on every run — which is what `DOX-A2` wants
  verified.
- `tests` → runs `nx affected -t test --exclude=@northguild/gmt,@northguild/gmt-oxlint`.
  `docs` has no `test` target, so zero tasks, exit 0. Note this job is **already** a no-op
  for every PR shape, since those two projects are the only ones with a `test` script.
- `gmt-matrix` → 20 jobs start and immediately echo-skip. Pre-existing.

Nothing breaks. The story's ask is to make the routing **explicit rather than accidental**:
add a `docs_changed` output plus a comment recording the intent. `DOX-A2`'s deploy workflow
needs exactly that signal anyway, so it is not throwaway work.

Also broaden the test-artifact collector to loop `packages apps` — it globs `packages/` only
today, so once `DOX-A3a` adds `docs:test` its artifacts would vanish silently.

## `DOX-A1` build notes

### Target definitions

All targets are `nx:run-commands` with `cwd: "{projectRoot}"` and `forwardAllArgs: false`
(`nx:run-commands` defaults `forwardAllArgs` to `true`, which would append stray CLI flags
to `astro build`).

- `build`, `dev`, `typecheck` all take `dependsOn: ["^build", "generate"]`. `^build` builds
  `@northguild/gmt` first; **`generate` is a sibling task and must be listed explicitly** —
  Nx does not chain it via `^`.
- `typecheck` **must** carry an explicit `dependsOn` to override `nx.json`'s
  `targetDefaults.typecheck.dependsOn: ["^typecheck"]`. Left as the default, it waits on
  gmt's `tsc --noEmit` across 504 source files while still not producing the `dist/` the
  docs actually need — slow _and_ wrong.
- Cache inputs must include `{workspaceRoot}/packages/*/package.json`. The version map's
  real input lives outside `{projectRoot}`, and `namedInputs.default` is
  `{projectRoot}/**/*` + `sharedGlobals` — so without it, a version bump leaves `docs:build`
  cached and the site ships a stale badge, exactly what the story forbids.
- `typecheck` runs `astro sync && astro check`, in that order. `.astro/` is gitignored, so
  `astro:content` types do not exist on a clean checkout. `@astrojs/check` and `typescript`
  must be devDependencies — Astro does not bundle the checker.
- **No `test` target in `DOX-A1`.** `DOX-A3a` introduces `docs:test` together with the
  committed stub and Vitest alias it needs; adding one now means a `vitest.config.ts` and a
  `vitest.workspace.ts` entry that A3a would immediately rewrite. `vitest.workspace.ts`
  currently defines only the `gmt` project, and whether `docs` joins it is A3a's call.

### `tsconfig.json`

Extends `astro/tsconfigs/strict`. Add `"nx": { "addTypecheckTarget": false }` — Nx's
documented escape hatch — or the plugin infers a `tsc --build --emitDeclarationOnly`
typecheck target, which is nonsense for Astro, and attaches the `@nx/js:typescript-sync`
generator to it.

Do **not** set `"types"`. Leaving it unset lets `.astro/types.d.ts` supply `astro/client`.

### Version map script

`apps/docs/scripts/generate-version-map.mjs`, following `scripts/sync-intent-version.mjs`'s
shape. Emits a **typed module** (`src/generated/versions.ts` exporting `packageVersions` and
`gmtVersion`), not JSON, so consumers get autocomplete and type errors. Write idempotently —
skip the write when content is unchanged, so `astro dev` does not HMR-thrash and Nx does not
see a spurious output change.

Lives in `apps/docs/scripts/`, not root `scripts/`: Nx's `default` named input is
`{projectRoot}/**/*`, so a root-level script would not invalidate the docs cache when
edited, and it belongs next to `DOX-A3a`'s future `build-reference.ts`.

**Gitignored, not committed** — deliberately breaking symmetry with `DOX-A3a`'s stub
pattern. A3a commits stubs so tests can import generated modules on a clean checkout; A1 has
no tests, and a stub version map would render a _wrong_ version badge, which is the precise
failure the story exists to prevent. Flag the asymmetry in the PR so A3a does not assume it.

### Starlight 0.41 API shapes

- `social` is an **array** of `{ icon, label, href }`. The old object form
  (`social: { github: "…" }`) was removed and fails with a Zod error, not a helpful message.
- Sidebar entries use `{ slug: "install" }`, not `{ link: "/install" }`.
- Set `site:` or `@astrojs/sitemap` (a Starlight dependency) warns on every build. A
  placeholder hostname is fine until `DOX-A2` provisions the real one.
- `@astrojs/starlight/loaders` and `@astrojs/starlight/schema` are both present in 0.41.9's
  exports map — `docsLoader()` and `docsSchema()` import from there.
- Pages using imports must be `.mdx`, not `.md`.

### Content sourcing

Port from `packages/gmt/README.md`; do not re-derive. Its figures (312,220 test executions,
15,611 tests, 17 locales) are audited.

| Page             | Source                                                        |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `index.mdx`      | Hero from README:3–11; four cards from "Why GMT" README:13–23 |
| `install.mdx`    | README:25–33, plus Package Layout README:151–179              |
| `core-rules.mdx` | README:44–58, plus Design Philosophy README:37–42             |

Populate every page's `description` frontmatter — `DOX-A3b` generates its `llms.txt` nav
index from titles and descriptions.

The sentinel fallback list (README:53–58) deserves visual weight — an `<Aside
type="caution">` rather than a plain list. The no-throw contract is the single most
surprising thing about the library.

## `DOX-A2` notes (not yet started)

- `wrangler.jsonc` with an `assets` binding: `directory: "./dist"`, `binding: "ASSETS"`,
  `not_found_handling: "404-page"`. **No `main`** — assets-only until Tier 6 adds `/api/*`.
- One Worker serves both the site and, later, `/api/*` in the same isolate. This removes
  CORS entirely, the second pipeline, and `DOX-C1`'s corpus-location question.
- **GitHub Pages was never enabled on this repo** (`gh api repos/northguild/gmt/pages` →
  404 as of 2026-08-26), so there is nothing to migrate away from.
- **A Cloudflare account is a hard dependency for shipping the MVP at all**, not just for
  the eventual chat. Confirm account access and that a token can be provisioned _before_
  starting.
- Verify `dependsOn: ["^build"]` actually orders the build correctly in CI, where the Nx
  cache is cold.
- Pagefind runs only in the production build, so the deployed site is the first place search
  can be tested.

## Ordered risk list — most likely to bite first

1. **Node.** `fnm use &&` on every command. Failure surfaces at the first `astro` call, not
   at install, so the error points at the wrong thing.
2. **Lockfile + build-script approval.** CI runs `pnpm approve-builds --all` _before_
   `pnpm install --frozen-lockfile`, and `pnpm-workspace.yaml`'s `allowBuilds` lists only
   `esbuild` and `nx`. Astro's esbuild is already allowed and pagefind ships prebuilt
   platform binaries, so this should be clean — but if `allowBuilds` needs new entries, the
   lockfile must be regenerated **in the same commit** or `--frozen-lockfile` fails in CI.
3. **Nx sync generator.** Once `apps/docs/tsconfig.json` exists, `@nx/js:typescript-sync`
   may flag the workspace permanently out of sync on the story's own local DoD command (CI
   skips sync entirely). If it does, `nx.json`'s
   `sync.disabledTaskSyncGenerators: ["@nx/js:typescript-sync"]` is the fix — but **verify
   the behavior before editing `nx.json`**, do not change it speculatively. If someone
   accepts the sync prompt it writes a project reference into the Astro tsconfig and breaks
   the "not a composite TS project" gate. Note the repo is arguably already in this state
   via `packages/gmt-oxlint`, which is absent from root `tsconfig.json` references.
4. **`oxlint.config.js` is dead** (finding 2). Bites at review time, when someone assumes
   the `files.include` edit means the app is linted.
5. **`prebuild`/`predev` never fire** (finding 4).
6. **`astro check` on a clean checkout** needs `astro sync` first.
7. **Nx cache staleness on a version bump** — verify concretely: build, hand-bump a version,
   rebuild, confirm a cache miss. This is the only real proof the version badge cannot go
   stale.
8. **`project.json` name vs `package.json` name** (finding 5).
9. **Starlight config API drift** — `social` array form, `{ slug }` sidebar entries.
