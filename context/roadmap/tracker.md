## GitHub Issues

Workflow: copy the title + description below into a new GitHub issue for each story, then paste the resulting issue number into the `GitHub Issue:` line for that story **both here and in the story's bullet above** (Story Group A–J). When starting a branch for a story, tell the agent which story ID (e.g. "work on C1") — it will find the matching issue link here and the full context in the Story Group section above.

Issue number tracker (fill in as issues are created). `Order` is the sequence to actually work these in — it follows the "Suggested Sequencing" section above (C-group first as a correctness fix, then A1–A5 straight through, then D-group, then F-group, then B-group, then G-group, then H-group, then I-group, then J-group, then E1–E5 last) — **not** ascending issue number. `Publish` marks when to cut a release after that story lands: nearly every story is additive-only (new functions, or new optional parameters defaulting to current behavior), so nearly every bump is `minor`; publish once per Story Group rather than per-story. Groups B, G, H, I, and J are adjacent in `Order` but are **not** bundled into one publish — see the Changeset note below on why interleaving unpublished groups is unsafe.

**One exception to "additive-only":** J0b moves two functions between published subpaths (`@burglekitt/gmt/plain/get` → `.../plain/calculate`). Root imports are unaffected, but deep-subpath importers break. Treat it as `minor` with an explicit changeset note naming both paths — not as a silent additive change. See [issues/J.md](issues/J.md).

**Changeset note:** each story's PR still adds its own `.changeset/*.md` file with a `minor` bump label (that's the correct per-change label, independent of when a release is cut). Changesets accumulate un-versioned in `.changeset/` across multiple merged PRs; only running `pnpm changeset:version` actually consumes them and cuts a release. Do **not** run `changeset:version` / publish until the `Publish` column for that row says so (i.e. wait for the last story in the Story Group, not the first). Story Groups are kept **un-interleaved** in `Order` specifically so this holds: `changeset:version` versions everything sitting in `.changeset/` at the time it's run, not just the "completing" group's own changesets, so interleaving two groups' stories would cause an earlier group's publish to sweep up a later, still-in-progress group's changesets too.

## Story Group J phases

Group J is split into two phases. Full specs for every row above live in [issues/J.md](issues/J.md).

**Phase 0 (Order 32–33) — pre-existing defects, fixed before the rest of the group.** Found by the same 2026-08-20 parity audit that produced Group J, but unrelated to its content:

- **J0a** — `overview.md` declares the "surpasses all comparison libraries" release checkpoint twice, with contradictory group lists (one includes Group I, the other omits it). Documentation-only; no changeset.
- **J0b** — `getLocaleDayOfWeek` and `getLocaleZonedDayOfWeek` sit in `plain/get/` and `zoned/get/`, which are otherwise exclusively current-moment accessors. Moves them to `calculate/` alongside their D2 siblings and records the resulting namespace rule in `coding-standards.md`. **Blocks J3 and J4** — those add four more value-taking accessors and have no unambiguous home until this lands. Note the release impact: root imports are unaffected, but `@burglekitt/gmt/plain/get` is a published subpath, so the changeset must name the change explicitly.

**Phase 1 (Order 34–48) — the fifteen parity gaps.** Ordered above by dependency (J1 setters are foundational; J2 builds on J1; J13 shares J11's regex work). `issues/J.md` additionally groups them into three priority tiers if the group ever needs trimming:

- **Tier 1** — J1, J3, J5, J6, J11. Highest real-world usage; J1 (no field setters anywhere in the library) is the single largest omission found.
- **Tier 2** — J2, J8, J9, J10, J12.
- **Tier 3** — J4, J7, J13, J14, J15.

**Decisions of record.** `issues/J.md` opens with five settled decisions that must not be re-opened — most importantly that a **token formatter is deliberately excluded, not missing** (it hard-codes field order and ships US ordering to every locale; J12's `formatToParts` is the i18n-correct replacement), while token *parsing* (J11) is in scope because no consumer-side workaround exists at any layer. A future parity audit needs to read that section before filing `toFormat` as a gap.
