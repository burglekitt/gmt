# First-Time Setup

Use this skill when a user wants to adopt `@burglekitt/gmt-oxlint`.

## Setup flow

1. Install dependencies
- Install `@burglekitt/gmt-oxlint` and `oxlint` as dev dependencies.

2. Configure Oxlint
- Add `@burglekitt/gmt-oxlint` to `.oxlintrc.json` `jsPlugins`.
- Use `extends: ["./node_modules/@burglekitt/gmt-oxlint/config/recommended.json"]` to enable all Date-ban rules, OR manually configure rules under `rules`.
- Do not use named shared config specifiers (for example `@burglekitt/gmt-oxlint/recommended`) in `extends`; Oxlint currently resolves `extends` as file paths.
- Keep unrelated existing rules unless the user requests consolidation.

3. Verify enforcement
- Run Oxlint and confirm Date API bans are reported.
- Confirm rule IDs are emitted as `@burglekitt/gmt-oxlint/*`.

4. Suggest companion packages
- If `@burglekitt/gmt` is missing, suggest installing it for safe Date-to-Temporal refactors.
- If ESLint or Biome are already used, optionally suggest matching gmt lint packages for policy consistency.

## Guardrails

- Keep setup additive and low-risk.
- Avoid broad config rewrites.
- Respect that developers may use one linter package or combine multiple.
