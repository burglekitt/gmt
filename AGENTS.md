# GMT Temporal Library — Agent Guide

`@burglekitt/gmt` is a Temporal-first date/time library. String-in, string-out. No `Date` object anywhere.

## Core Rules (Quick Reference)

These are the non-negotiables. Full detail is in the context files above.

1. **No `Date` object.** Use `@js-temporal/polyfill` exclusively.
2. **String-in, string-out.** Public APIs accept ISO 8601 strings; return strings, numbers, booleans, or arrays.
3. **Invalid input returns a sentinel, never throws.** `""` for strings, `null` for numbers, `false` for booleans, `[]` for arrays.
4. **Wrap all Temporal calls in `try-catch`.** `.from()`, `.add()`, `.since()`, etc. throw `RangeError` on bad input.
5. **Keep `plain/` and `zoned/` strictly separate.** Never mix `PlainDateTime` and `ZonedDateTime`.
6. **Full locale matrix for any locale-aware function.** 17 locales, explicit rows, `hasFullIcu` ternaries where output differs.
7. **Use pre-built mocks for error-path tests.** See `packages/gmt/src/test/mocks`.
8. **JSDoc with `@example` on every public function.** Cover valid, invalid, and edge-case inputs.
